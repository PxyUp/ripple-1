# Directives 

Directives are custom attributes that a hooks for special functionality. If you've used Angular they're similar to things like `ng-click`, `ng-controller` etc.

You can define your own directives that can easily be re-used across views. A directive looks like this:

```html
<button on-click="save">Submit</button>
```

This isn't a real attribute, it's a custom one that will trigger some functionality added to the `View`.

## Creating Directives

The `View` has a `directive` method for adding directives:

```js
View.directive('on-click', function(value, el, view){
  el.addEventListener('click', value);
});
```

Within the binding you have access to the `view` instance, the element the attribute is on, the attribute name and the current value.

You can also use the longer verson of this for more complex directives:

```js
View.directive('on-click', {
  bind: function(el, view) {
    // This is called once when the binding is created.
    // Use this to setup any event listeners.
  },
  update: function(value, el, view) {
    // This is called whenever the value of the directive changes.
    // If the value passed to it is an expression, this function
    // will be called whenever that expression changes.
  },
  unbind: function(el, view){
    // This is called once when the binding is removed.
    // Cleanup any listeners here.
  }
});
```

When passing data to directives, you can use expressions to pass dynamic data
to them.

```html
<div my-binding="{{name}}"></div>
```

The `update` method will be called whenever this value changes.
